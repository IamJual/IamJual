# "Hello, World!" I'm Jual!


A passionate modder and programming hobbyist with a deep love for gaming. I enjoy poking my nose around Nintendo Wii and game development. Currently, I use C++ and Java as my primary programming languages, but that might change. If I'm not programming, you'll probably find me in the wonderful worlds of video games!
